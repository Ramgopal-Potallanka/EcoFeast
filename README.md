1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set your API keys in `app.py`:
   - Replace `SPOONACULAR_API_KEY` and `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` with your own keys.
5. Run the backend server:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
   The backend will run at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
